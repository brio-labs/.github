## 1. The Vision
<a name="vision"></a>
The era of training is stabilizing. Most models are bruteforcing most benchmarks to the point that they become irrelevant. We think that this issue is caused by one big problem. There is too much paper but nothing to concretize them. Instead we prefer training to death the biggest model possible.
One model to rule them all they say.
We think among others, that maybe connecting smaller models, making deep recursive thinking like human do may be a good idea.

After all Poetiq tried it and it worked very well on tests like ARC-AGI. Why not applying the same principles to real world application like development?

If nature made us think like that, there is maybe a reason, we try to turn LLMs into builders, not overtrained monster.

> "A model answers a question. Brio solves a problem." would describe what we try to build.

## 2. Adaptive Intelligence: The Economics of Thought
<a name="adaptive"></a>
High-level reasoning is expensive. Raw execution shouldn't be.

Brio rejects the "One Model to Rule Them All" dogma. We treat intelligence as a tiered supply chain. Our kernel routes tasks to the most efficient model for the specific node in your graph, balancing **latency, cost, and perplexity.**

### The Hierarchy of Compute
Instead of burning budget on a monolithic call, Brio orchestrates a symphony of specialized weights:

* **The Sprinters (Execution & Syntax):** For high-speed code generation and formatting, we leverage hyper-optimized, low-latency models like **Devstral 2 2512** or **GLM 4.7**. Fast, cheap, and brutally effective at following instructions.
* **The Thinkers (Strategy & Verification):** When the system needs to architect a solution, audit code for security, or reason through ambiguity, it escalates to heavy lifters like **Claude 4.5 Opus**.

**Result:** You get the reasoning depth of a frontier model with the throughput and cost-efficiency of a lightweight runner.

## 3. Topology Agnostic: Your Workflow, Your Rules
<a name="topology"></a>
We provide the primitives. You define the physics.

While we offer robust presets (like the classic *Architect → Builder → Critic* loop), Brio enforces no specific topology. You are free to structure the "Service Mesh of Minds" exactly how your domain requires.

### Design Your Graph
The Brio Kernel is a blank canvas for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or recursive loops:

* **The Linear Factory:** *Researcher → Summarizer → Formatter*
* **The recursive Loop:** *Coder ↔ Tester (Repeat until 0 errors)*
* **The Council:** *3 separate Agents propose solutions → 1 Judge synthesizes the best.*

Whether you need a simple linear pipe or a complex, self-healing swarm, Brio's strictly headless architecture adapts to the shape of your problem.

## 4. Engineering Philosophy
We don't deal in hype. We deal in **deterministic control of non-deterministic systems.**

Our architecture is built on three non-negotiable pillars:

| Pillar | Concept |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strict Isolation** | **The Sandbox.** Intelligence needs boundaries. Every agent operates in a jailed environment (WASI) with atomic state management. We never let AI "hallucinate" changes to your production system. |
| **Zero-Copy Mesh** | **The Speed.** Thought should be instantaneous. We bypass serialization overhead, allowing agents to share memory and context via high-frequency internal channels. |
| **Active Orchestration** | **The Supervisor.** We do not rely on "autonomous" drift. A central policy engine dictates control flow, ensuring that agents serve the objective, not their own loops. |

## 5. The Brio Standard
We are defining the interface for the future of software.
* **Headless by Default:** We build kernels, not chatbots.
* **Safety First:** Intelligence without containment is a hazard.
* **Lean Core:** We reject bloat. We build precise tools for precise work.

## 6. Join the Swarm
<a name="join"></a>
We are looking for engineers who are bored with prompt engineering and ready to build **cognitive architectures**.

If you care about:
* Distributed Systems & Graph Theory
* Sandboxing & Security
* High-Performance Orchestration
* The mechanization of reasoning

**You are home.**
